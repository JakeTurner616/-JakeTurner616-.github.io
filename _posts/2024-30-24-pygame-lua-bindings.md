This project is quite simple as it aims to streamline the process of Pygame development through the use of the Lua scripting language, while utilizing the robust feature set of Pygame. The idea is to create a framework for fast Pygame protyping that could possibly even work as an embedded application.

Lua (using pygame to lua bindings):
```lua
clear_canvas()
draw_text(50, 50, "Hello Pygame from lua!", "Arial", 30, 'red')
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeTurner616/pygame-lua-bindings/main/docs/hello_world_lua.PNG" alt="hello world in pygame with lua">
</div>

Compare to vanilla pygame:
```python
import pygame
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
font = pygame.font.SysFont('Arial', 30)
red = (124, 0, 0)
green = (0, 255, 0)
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    screen.blit(font.render('Hello Pygame from python!', True, red), (50, 50))
    pygame.display.flip()
pygame.quit()
```

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Lua-Pygame Bindings**: Seamlessly integrates Lua scripting capabilities with Pygame's graphical functions.
- **High-Level Abstractions**: Handles events and main game loop through Lua, reducing the need for verbose Python code.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across different systems where Python can run.
